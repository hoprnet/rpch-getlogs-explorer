# Current Status

RPCh development is currently paused. While we fully believe in the need for trustless RPC calls, HOPR is a small team and our resources are currently better spent on other projects which address the problem from a different angle, including Gnosis VPN. If youâ€™re interested in working on RPCh, using RPCh, or have any other questions, please contact the HOPR team.


# GetLogs dApp showcasing RPCh

`yarn` - installs all node dependencies.

`yarn start` - runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`yarn build` - builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Branches

- [main](https://github.com/hoprnet/rpch-getlogs-explorer/tree/main) holds the normal dApp without RPCh integration
- [rpch](https://github.com/hoprnet/rpch-getlogs-explorer/tree/rpch) holds the dApp with RPCh integration ([Diff](https://github.com/hoprnet/rpch-getlogs-explorer/compare/main...rpch))
