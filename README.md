# GetLogs dApp showcasing RPCh

`yarn` - installs all node dependencies.

`yarn start` - runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`yarn build` - builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
